In this project I could learn how Mailchimp works and its main funcionalities. Node <options> in HTTP request function is a powerful tool to access those APIs and FS library is really interesting to read and keep secrets inside project folder.
As Github won't allow requests to their servers, I'll upload this API project on my personal website in the future.
